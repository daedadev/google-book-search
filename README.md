# Google Book Search

## Description

This project uses the Google Book API to search and view books. With a React front-end and a MySQL back-end you can quickly and easily view, save, and delete books. It was a lot of fun making a more practical application and utilizing skills I have learned thus far to put together a project completely on my own, from templating to styling I had an extremely fun time.

Thank you for visiting my project and I hope you enjoy.

## Usage

The Application is Deployed Live Here: 

Searching for a book and pressing enter will go through the API and return results accordingly.

After clicking save on a book it will be added to your library which you can view by clicking the "Saved" button in the top left.
![Saved ](/screenshot2.PNG?raw=true)

Modal that pops up with the save or delete function on either the Search page or Saved books page respectively.
